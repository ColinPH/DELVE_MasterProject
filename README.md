# DELVE_MasterProject
Code base for my master thesis game, DELVE.

In this project I was the only programmer.
Most of the code has been writen during this project (18 weeks).
Some of the code has been writen by me in my past projects and reused.
All the code shared here should have been writen by me.

This should be a good representation of what I can achieve and how I work. Some classes may have received more polish than others based on the time I spent on it.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Looking for some polished work ? You should have a look at:
1_The Collision System folder, made before this project, I used it to control collisions through multiple layers.
2_The file HookAbility.cs which contains the main ability of the game.
